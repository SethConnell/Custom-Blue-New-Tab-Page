# Custom-Blue-New-Tab-Page

Google Chrome's default New Tab page is boring. I decided to make something a little more creative.

## How to set up:

Download the project somewhere onto your computer, then install the "New Tab Redirect Options" Google Chrome Extention to set the index.html file as your landing page.
